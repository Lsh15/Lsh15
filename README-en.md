Hi, My name is SeungHhun Lee

Back in colleae, I majored in programming.

In addition, I used to work in the Android OS development department as a researcher.

I have more than two years of experience in programming.

My specialty is a stable personality and high responsibility.

Most of the work was done alone due to the lack of personnel in the development department.

As a result, I have strong problem-solving skills.

Also, I take care of my work in a self-directed way.

I'm good at Android and Python programming.
